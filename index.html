    <p>Port Harcourt is the capital and largest city of Rivers State in Nigeria,
        located in the oil-rich Niger Delta region. Founded in 1912 to export coal and 
        later becoming a hub for Nigeria's oil economy, it is home to two main oil refineries 
        and deepwater port facilities for various exports. The city is known for its significant 
        urbanisation and modernization, and it hosts the major annual Carniriv music festival.  </p>
